## Introduction

_**It wasn't that long ago**_ that streaming even 480p quality content wasn't reliable for a lot of people.  Torrent downloads shipped as 40+ part RAR archives with SFVs included to run checksums to deal with the unreliable Internet.
Streaming options were limited. Downloads took hours or days to finish and often didn't end up being what you expected.  Whether a given device could deal with the audio and video codecs of a file was a crapshoot.

Your only option to get exactly what you wanted at the quality you wanted without fuss was to buy DVDs and Blurays, which took up space and have a problematic and expensive future:
when old technology falls out of favor all of the market drops off -- usually leaving you to choose between super low-quality gear marketed towards people who "just want it to play" and ultra high-end hi-fi gear meant for enthusiasts.
No mid tier.  Not great.

_**Today,**_ the Internet is fast, cheap and reliable for most people living in urban areas.  Downloads are more predictable and file compatability (with transcoding) is no longer an issue.
Streaming can now easily handle the highest quality of audio and visual that content has to offer without any compromises.  We're in the digital age.  It's cheaper, better for the environment, and faster.  _**Embrace it.**_

In this post, we'll be going over everything needed to set up your own private streaming service that utilizes [RealDebrid](https://real-debrid.com/) as a storage backend.

This is meant to be a basic setup that doesn't require owning a public domain, having internal dns, or having managed network equipment.  Configuration required the aforementioned items is outside the scope of this post.

>Without going into the nuances of theoretical lost revenue for everyone involved in making content exist, if **everyone** downloaded content without paying -- there would be no content.  If you have the means to do so, you should pay for content.

## All the moving parts

### PVR
These are the services that will handle collecting media.

#### Prowlarr
    [Prowlarr](https://github.com/Prowlarr/Prowlarr) is an indexer manager/proxy that integrates with your various PVR apps. Prowlarr supports management of both Torrent Trackers and Usenet Indexers. It integrates seamlessly with Radarr and Sonarr -- offering complete management of your indexers with no per app Indexer setup required.

#### Sonarr
    [Sonarr](https://github.com/Sonarr/Sonarr) is a PVR for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new episodes of your favorite shows and will grab, sort and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of files already downloaded when a better quality format becomes available.

#### Radarr
[Radarr](https://github.com/Radarr/Radarr) is a movie collection manager for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new movies and will interface with clients and indexers to grab, sort, and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of existing files in the library when a better quality format becomes available.

#### Overseerr (optional)
[Overseerr](https://github.com/sct/overseerr) is a free and open source software application for managing requests for your media library. It integrates with your existing services, such as Sonarr, Radarr, and Plex!

### Remote Storage
These are the services that will manage and mount the remote storage.

#### RealDebrid
[RealDebrid](https://real-debrid.com/) is a paid streaming link service — it acts like a massive, shared torrent cache. When anyone downloads a torrent through Real-Debrid, it’s stored and cached on their servers. If you grab that same file later, you’re pulling it directly from Real-Debrid at full speed, often instantly. This also means you can use it as “unlimited” cloud storage for Plex: add a torrent, let Real-Debrid cache it, then stream it straight to your Plex library without keeping the files locally.

There are a few other options out there, but because of slight differences in the way they work, support through various apps is a mixed bag.  Support for RealDebrid is the default on every application in this post, as well as the alternatives not mentioned.

#### Zurg
[Zurg](https://github.com/debridmediamanager/zurg-testing) is self-hosted Real-Debrid webdav server written from scratch. Together with rclone it can mount your Real-Debrid torrent library into your file system like Dropbox.

#### Rclone
[Rclone](https://github.com/rclone/rclone) ("rsync for cloud storage") is a command-line program to sync files and directories to and from different cloud storage providers.

### Download clients
These are the services that will fullfill the downloads requested by the PVR apps.  The optional apps downloading locally for certain content you want available without Internet.
Managing what is local or remote is outside the scope of thos post.

#### Decypharr
[Decypharr](https://github.com/sirrobot01/decypharr) is an implementation of QbitTorrent with Multiple Debrid service support, written in Go.
Decypharr combines the power of QBittorrent with popular Debrid services to enhance your media management. It provides a familiar interface for Sonarr, Radarr, and other *Arr applications.

#### qBittorrent (optional)
[qBittorrent](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent) is a bittorrent client programmed in C++ / Qt that uses libtorrent (sometimes called libtorrent-rasterbar) by Arvid Norberg.

#### Sabnzbd (optional)
[SABnzbd](https://github.com/sabnzbd/sabnzbd) is an Open Source Binary Newsreader written in Python.

### Streaming
These are the services that can handle streaming the media to client devices.  I recommend Plex, but I've listed the main alternatives. Why you might choose an alternative is outside the scope of this post. 

#### Plex
[Plex](https://www.plex.tv/) is a powerful media server platform that lets you organize, stream, and enjoy your personal collection of movies, TV shows, music, and photos — all from one place. Once set up, Plex automatically fetches artwork, trailers, and detailed metadata to make your library look and feel like a professional streaming service. You can access your content anywhere, on virtually any device, and even share your library with friends and family. Plex also offers free ad-supported movies, TV, and live channels, making it a one-stop entertainment hub for both your personal media and online content.

#### Emby (alternative)
[Emby](https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby) is a personal media server with apps on just about every device.
It features a REST-based API with built-in documention to facilitate client development. We also have client libraries for our API to enable rapid development.

#### Jellyfin (alternative)
[Jellyfin](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin) is a Free Software Media System that puts you in control of managing and streaming your media. It is an alternative to the proprietary Emby and Plex, to provide media from a dedicated server to end-user devices via multiple apps. Jellyfin is descended from Emby's 3.5.2 release and ported to the .NET Core framework to enable full cross-platform support.

### Design

![plex-wd-workflow](/static/images/plex-rd-workflow.png)

As illustrated in the example above, the goal is to download and store content on RealDebrid and get Plex to see that content as local, organized files.

1. Zurg mounts RealDebrid via API calls and then presents it as a WEBDAV share.
2. Rclone mounts the WEBDAV share and makes it accessible to other containers.
3. Decypharr, Radarr, Sonarr, and Plex all mount the Rclone mount to ensure symlinks resolve.
4. Radarr/Sonarr use Prowlarr to find the best version of your requests and send the torrent to Decypharr.
5. Decypharr sends the torrent to RealDebrid to download via API calls.  Once completed, a symlink is created from the rclone mount to the downloads folder.
6. Radarr/Sonarr see the file in the downloads folder as complete and performs processing.  It moves the symlink to the Plex library, organizes, and renames the file.
7. Radarr/Sonarr tell Plex to scan its library for the new files just added.
8. Plex sees the remote files as local, well-organized files.
9. Plex, if necessary, converts files for compatability on the fly and streams them to client devices.
